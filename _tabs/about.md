I studied audio engineering at PXL-Music and continued to work in music for about 2 years.
In that time i worked both in the field as an audio engineer and performed audio related research at PXL-Music Research.

Afterwards i had the amazing opportunity to teach Audio Technology and Digital Audio both privately as well as at PXL-Music.

The research project showed me that my ideal world lies on the crossroads between music and technology.
And so i decided to pick up programming as a means to combine the two.

This brings me here, and i hope to share some amazing things soon.
